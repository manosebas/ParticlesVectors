# Vector Particle Image Display

![ParticleImage](./images/1.png)

## Description
This project transforms a user-uploaded image into a visual representation using colored particles.

Each pixel of the image is mapped to a particle, recreating the image with a unique particle effect.

Clicking changes the display to various images, with particles dynamically adjusting to the new graphic.

The project is highly customizable and expandable for diverse visual applications.

## Images
Here are some examples of the particle effects in action:

<img src="./images/1.png" alt="Particle Image 1" width="480" height="320">
<img src="./images/2.png" alt="Particle Image 2" width="480" height="280">
<img src="./images/3.png" alt="Particle Image 3" width="320" height="480">
<img src="./images/4.png" alt="Particle Image 4" width="320" height="480">
<img src="./images/5.png" alt="Particle Image 5" width="320" height="480">
